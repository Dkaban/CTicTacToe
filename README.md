# C Tic Tac Toe

## Platform: Windows Console
## IDE: Visual Studio
This program is being created using Visual Studio and is a simple console app.
It's a basic TicTacToe game that allows the player to play vs another player.

### Functionality
- The board is displayed to the player
- The player is asked to enter a number to choose which slot they want their X or O in
- The updated board is displayed and the player is asked to make a choice again
- Game ends when the board is full and no alignment or an alignment is matched

#### Note
This was created as a project that doesn't use functions, the intention was to create TicTacToe in one C file and then run it in UNIX.
I will attach the makefile I used to run it as well.
